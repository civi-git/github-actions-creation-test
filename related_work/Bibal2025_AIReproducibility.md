## CS197 Analysis Structure

### 1. Problem
**What problem does it solve? Why does it matter?**

The reproducibility challenge in scientific research where:
- Published findings cannot be independently reproduced despite open science initiatives
- Reproduction attempts take enormous time (over 30 hours per paper)
- Barriers include missing hyperparameters, undocumented steps, incomplete datasets
- Manual reproduction efforts don't scale to the volume of scientific literature

This matters because irreproducible research undermines scientific validity and wastes massive human effort in failed reproduction attempts.

### 2. Prior Assumptions
**What assumption did earlier work assume? Why was it inadequate?**

Prior approaches assumed:
- Making code and data available is sufficient for reproducibility
- Human experts can efficiently reproduce computational results manually
- Documentation provided by authors is complete and accurate
- Reproducibility barriers can be detected through manual inspection

These assumptions were inadequate because:
- They ignored the complexity of computational environments and dependencies
- They underestimated the time and expertise required for reproduction
- They assumed perfect documentation, which rarely exists
- They couldn't scale to handle the growing volume of computational research

### 3. Insight
**What's the novel contribution?**

The key insight is that **AI-powered copilots** can systematically:
- **Analyze manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials** automatically
- **Generate structured Jupyter Notebooks** for computational reproduction
- **Detect barriers to reproducibility** systematically (missing hyperparameters, undocumented steps, etc.)
- **Reduce reproduction time** from over 30 hours to about 1 hour

### 4. Technical Approach
**How is it implemented?**

**OpenPub platform** with modular copilot architecture:
- **Reproducibility Copilot** - focuses on computational reproduction
- **Manuscript analysis** - extracts computational steps and requirements
- **Code analysis** - identifies missing dependencies and parameters
- **Automated notebook generation** - creates executable reproduction environments
- **Barrier detection system** - systematically identifies reproducibility issues

### 5. Evaluation
**How was it validated?**

Validation through:
- **Previously studied papers** with known reproducibility benchmarks
- **Time measurement** - reduction from 30+ hours to ~1 hour
- **Coverage analysis** - high coverage of figures, tables, and results
- **Systematic barrier detection** - identification of missing components
- **Quality assessment** - comparison against manual reproduction efforts

Results showed substantial time savings while maintaining high reproduction quality.

### 6. Impact
**What are the implications? How will it change the field?**

This work demonstrates AI can:
- **Dramatically reduce reproduction costs** - making reproducibility verification feasible at scale
- **Systematically detect reproducibility barriers** - improving research quality standards
- **Enable large-scale reproducibility verification** - across entire scientific domains
- **Support reviewers and readers** - with automated reproducibility assessment
- **Contribute to transparent science** - through systematic verification processes

The modular architecture also provides foundation for extending AI assistance to other open science objectives.

## Key Assumptions Challenged

**Literature-level bit flip:** The assumption that reproducibility verification must be a manual, expert-driven process. Instead, AI copilots can systematically automate reproducibility analysis and verification at scale.

## Connection to GitHub Actions

This work shows how AI can be integrated into automated workflows to verify reproducibility, providing a blueprint for incorporating AI-powered reproducibility checks into GitHub Actions pipelines.
