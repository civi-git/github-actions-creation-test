## CS197 Analysis Structure

### 1. Problem
**What problem does it solve? Why does it matter?**

Scientific computing faces critical challenges:
- Need to increase scientific rigor, reproducibility, and transparency
- Growing computational demands and data volumes
- Difficulty scaling from local to cluster computing environments
- Limited familiarity with best practices (data governance, code versioning, library management)
- Stark differences between local development and production deployment

### 2. Prior Assumptions
**What assumption did earlier work assume? Why was it inadequate?**

Prior scientific computing approaches assumed:
- Researchers can manually manage the complexity of scaling from local to cluster environments
- Ad-hoc solutions for data processing pipelines are sufficient
- Limited tooling integration between development and deployment stages
- Researchers naturally adopt best practices without systematic guidance

These assumptions were inadequate because they led to:
- Poor reproducibility and transparency
- Friction between development stages
- Difficulty in maintaining consistent computational environments
- Limited scalability across different computing platforms

### 3. Insight
**What's the novel contribution?**

The key insight is that DevOps tools from industry (Git, CI/CD, containers) can be directly leveraged to create an integrated framework for scientific computing that:
- Uses a **single container** that supports both local interactive sessions AND HPC/cloud deployment
- Combines Git repositories with CI/CD engines for automated workflows
- Enables **decentralized data pipelines** across multiple computational environments
- Provides minimal friction between all stages of the research lifecycle

### 4. Technical Approach
**How is it implemented?**

The framework integrates three DevOps tools:
1. **Git repositories** - for version control and collaboration
2. **CI/CD engines** - for automated testing and deployment (GitLab CI/CD)
3. **Containers** - for environment consistency across platforms

Key implementation details:
- Single container design that works locally (interactive sessions) and in production (HPC/Kubernetes)
- Custom GitLab CI/CD executors for Slurm and Google Kubernetes Engine Autopilot
- Support for the full lifecycle: data acquisition → processing → analysis → publication

### 5. Evaluation
**How was it validated?**

The framework was:
- Successfully deployed within the research group
- Validated across experimental acquisition systems and computational clusters
- Tested with open-source, purpose-built executors
- Applied to real scientific workflows spanning individual, on-premises, and cloud environments

### 6. Impact
**What are the implications? How will it change the field?**

This work demonstrates that established industry DevOps practices can be directly applied to scientific computing to:
- **Increase reproducibility** through consistent computational environments
- **Improve transparency** through automated documentation and versioning  
- **Enable scalability** across different computing platforms seamlessly
- **Reduce friction** between research stages from development to deployment
- **Democratize best practices** by making them accessible to researchers without deep technical expertise

## Key Assumptions Challenged

**Literature-level bit flip:** The assumption that scientific computing requires specialized, domain-specific tooling. Instead, industry-proven DevOps tools can be directly leveraged for scientific workflows.

## Connection to GitHub Actions

This paper provides strong theoretical foundation for using GitHub Actions in scientific computing by demonstrating how CI/CD pipelines can be central to reproducible research workflows.
