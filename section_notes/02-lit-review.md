# Literature Review

GitHub Actions becomes the backbone of scientific reproducibility. Every experiment, data analysis, or model training step is version-controlled, tested, documented, and optionally published â€” with minimal manual intervention.

## Core Research Question

How can GitHub Actions transform from a software development tool into the universal infrastructure for scientific reproducibility, challenging fundamental assumptions about how scientific research is conducted and validated?

## Literature-Level Bit Flips Identified

The systematic review of current literature reveals three critical assumptions that span multiple research areas, creating opportunities for transformative research contributions:

### 1. From Post-Hoc to Native Reproducibility
**Current Literature Assumption**: Reproducibility is something added after research completion - a post-processing step for packaging and sharing completed experiments.

**Evidence Across Literature**:
- Bibal et al. (2025) focus on reproducing *published* findings
- Costa et al. (2020) emphasize packaging *completed* experiments  
- Traditional approaches treat reproducibility as verification rather than enablement

**Proposed Flip**: Reproducibility becomes the native environment for conducting research, not just reproducing it. GitHub Actions workflows become the primary interface through which scientists conduct experiments, analyze data, and iterate on findings.

### 2. From Domain-Specific to Universal Infrastructure
**Current Literature Assumption**: Scientific domains require specialized, custom reproducibility tools and frameworks.

**Evidence Across Literature**:
- Most existing tools target specific domains (astronomy, biology, etc.)
- Limited cross-domain compatibility and standardization
- Fragmented ecosystem of reproducibility solutions

**Proposed Flip**: Universal CI/CD infrastructure (GitHub Actions) can serve all scientific domains through common patterns, creating a unified platform for scientific reproducibility that transcends disciplinary boundaries.

### 3. From Manual to Automated Quality Assurance  
**Current Literature Assumption**: Scientific quality and validity require human expert verification through traditional peer review processes.

**Evidence Across Literature**:
- Pritchard et al. (2024) work toward formal verification but still require human setup
- Manual reproduction attempts remain the gold standard
- Limited automated quality assurance in scientific workflows

**Proposed Flip**: Automated systems can provide continuous, real-time scientific quality assurance that exceeds human capabilities in consistency and scale.

## Synthesis of Key Findings

### Convergent Technical Architecture
Multiple independent research efforts have converged on the **Container + CI/CD + Version Control** pattern:

- **Nuyujukian (2023)**: Demonstrates Git + CI/CD + Containers for scientific computing
- **Ariamajd et al. (2025)**: Implements GitHub Actions + Containerization for research software engineering
- **Costa et al. (2020)**: Develops systematic environment packaging for reproducibility

This convergence suggests a mature technical foundation ready for broader application.

### The Automation Imperative
All reviewed literature recognizes that manual approaches to scientific reproducibility fundamentally cannot scale:

- **Time Inefficiency**: Manual reproduction takes 30+ hours per paper (Bibal et al., 2025)
- **Consistency Issues**: Manual environment recreation is error-prone (Costa et al., 2020)
- **Resource Diversion**: Manual software engineering diverts scientists from research (Ariamajd et al., 2025)

### Infrastructure-as-Code for Science
An emerging consensus shows that scientific workflows benefit from treating infrastructure, environments, and processes as code:

- **DevOps Applicability**: Industry DevOps tools directly apply to scientific computing (Nuyujukian, 2023)
- **Configuration Management**: Configuration-as-Code enables reproducible research environments (Ariamajd et al., 2025)
- **Automated Workflows**: Systematic automation reduces human error and improves consistency (Costa et al., 2020)

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

### 1. Native Research Workflow Integration
**Current Gap**: Limited research on using GitHub Actions as the primary research environment rather than just a reproduction tool.

**Research Opportunity**: Investigate how GitHub Actions can become the native platform for conducting research, enabling real-time collaboration, automated quality checks, and seamless transition from exploration to publication.

### 2. Cross-Domain Reproducibility Standards  
**Current Gap**: Lack of universal standards that work across all scientific domains.

**Research Opportunity**: Develop universal reproducibility patterns and abstractions that can be applied regardless of scientific domain, creating true interoperability across disciplines.

### 3. Automated Scientific Quality Assurance
**Current Gap**: Limited work on automated validation of scientific quality in real-time workflows.

**Research Opportunity**: Create automated systems that provide continuous scientific quality assurance during research conduct, potentially exceeding traditional peer review in consistency and thoroughness.

## Implications for Scientific Practice

This literature review positions GitHub Actions as the potential **universal infrastructure for scientific reproducibility** that could reshape scientific practice by:

1. **Making reproducibility intrinsic rather than extrinsic** to research workflows
2. **Unifying fragmented reproducibility tools** under a common platform  
3. **Enabling continuous quality assurance** rather than post-hoc validation
4. **Scaling best practices automatically** rather than relying on manual adoption

The evidence suggests the field is ready for a fundamental transformation in how scientific reproducibility is conceptualized and implemented.
